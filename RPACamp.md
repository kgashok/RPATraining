## _What is RPA?_

Robotic Process Automation or RPA handles repetitive business processes using software robots to perform tasks and trigger error-free responses 24/7. It’s a type of software that enables  _**automation of even complex digital processes**_  by performing them much in the way that human users would perform them.

## _Why RPA?_

A career in RPA is considered to be very effective and the emerging graduates can easily expect a major share of employment opportunities across the world. Also, pay packages with good skill-sets in this field are relatively higher when compared to other fields. RPA is implemented in various sectors like Education, Banking and Finance, Insurance, Health care and Manufacturing etc., across the world. Types of applications automated using RPA are as Windows, Web, SAP and Mainframe etc.

## _Why UiPath?_

**[UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/)**  is a  _Windows-based desktop_  Robotic Process Automation software tool architects to automate business processes within Enterprises. This tool enables organizations to execute processes more efficiently by  _automa?ting monotonous and repetitive tasks_.

## _Components of UiPath_

-   **UiPath Studio**

An advance tool that enables you to design automation processes in a visual manner, through diagrams.

-   **UiPath Robot**

Executes the processes built in studio, as a human does. Robots can work unattended (run without human supervision) or as assistants (a human trigger the process).

-   **UiPath Orchestrator**

A web application that enables you to deploy, schedule, monitor and manage Robots and Processes, while business exception handling is available through centralized work queues.

-   **Selectors**

The selector is a string of characters (VB expression) used to identify objects on the screen. The selector is one of the properties of UI activities and has an XML format. All the activities in UiPath Studio related to graphical elements have the selector property.  [more....](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/docs/about-selectors)
